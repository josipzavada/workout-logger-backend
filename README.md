# Workout Tracker API

This API provides endpoints for managing workout plans and logs. It's built using Next.js and Vercel Postgres.

## Database Structure

The database consists of the following tables:
- `workout_target`
- `workout`
- `workout_set`
- `workout_plan_item`
- `workout_log`

Note: Only the `workout_log` table can be modified by users. All other tables are managed by personal trainers through their admin app.
